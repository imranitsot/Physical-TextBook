# Glossary

## A-M
- **Actuator**: A component that moves or controls a mechanism or system (e.g., DC Motor, Servo, Hydraulic piston).
- **DDS (Data Distribution Service)**: The networking middleware standard used by ROS 2 for real-time communication.
- **Domain Randomization**: A Sim-to-Real technique where simulation parameters (friction, mass, lighting) are randomly varied to make the policy robust.
- **FK (Forward Kinematics)**: Computing the position/orientation of the end-effector given the joint angles.
- **Gazebo**: An open-source 3D robotics simulator that integrates heavily with ROS.
- **IK (Inverse Kinematics)**: Computing the required joint angles to reach a desired end-effector position.
- **IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit)**: A sensor measuring specific force (accelerometer), angular rate (gyroscope), and magnetic field (magnetometer).
- **Jetson**: NVIDIA's series of embedded computing boards designed for edge AI applications.

## N-Z
- **PID Controller**: A control loop mechanism employing proportional, integral, and derivative terms to correct error.
- **PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization)**: A popular Reinforcement Learning algorithm known for stability and ease of tuning.
- **ROS 2**: The second generation of the Robot Operating System, designed for production and real-time support.
- **Sim-to-Real Gap**: The performance drop observed when transferring a policy from simulation to the physical world.
- **SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping)**: The computational problem of constructing or updating a map of an unknown environment while simultaneously keeping track of an agent's location within it.
- **Tokenizer**: In VLA systems, the component that breaks down text and images into discrete tokens for the Transformer to process.
- **URDF (Unified Robot Description Format)**: An XML textual format used to describe the kinematic and dynamic properties of a robot.
- **VLA (Vision-Language-Action)**: A model architecture that takes visual and textual inputs and outputs low-level robot actions.
- **Xacro**: An XML macro language used to construct URDF files more cleanly (reducing duplication).
- **ZMP (Zero Moment Point)**: A dynamic stability criterion for legged robots; the point where the total inertial and gravity forces produce no horizontal moment.
