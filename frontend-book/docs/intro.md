**Connecting AI Agents to Physical Robot Systems**

<img src="/img/welcome_cover.png" class="module-header-image" />

Welcome to the **Physical AI Textbook**. This comprehensive guide is designed to bridge the gap between high-level Artificial Intelligence (Vision, LLMs, RL) and low-level Robotic Control (Motors, Kinematics, Hardware).

## The Mission

In the era of "Embodied Intelligence," code does not just run on servers—it moves atoms. This textbook will navigate you through:

1.  **The Nervous System**: ROS 2, Middleware, and Real-time communication.
2.  **The Digital Twin**: Simulation in Gazebo and Unity.
3.  **Hardware**: Choosing the right sensors, actuators, and compute (Jetson/Orin).
4.  **The Brain**: Integrating Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models and Large Language Models (LLMs) into the control loop.
5.  **The Body**: Designing stable, bipedal humanoid platforms.

## How to use this Textbook

This documentation is structured as a linear course, but serves equally well as a reference.

*   **Beginners**: Start with **Module 1** and work your way through the simulation setup.
*   **Hardware Engineers**: Jump to **Module 4** and **Module 7** for electronics and mechanical design.
*   **AI Researchers**: Focus on **Module 5** and **Module 6** for VLA and RL implementation details.

## Getting Started

Select **[Module 1: The Nervous System (ROS 2)](./module-1-ros2-nervous-system)** from the sidebar to begin your journey into the nervous system of robots.
