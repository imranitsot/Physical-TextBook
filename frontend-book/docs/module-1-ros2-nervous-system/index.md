# Module 1: The Nervous System (ROS 2)

The "Nervous System" of a robot involves sending signals between sensors (eyes/ears), the brain (compute), and actuators (muscles). on ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2) as middleware for humanoid robot control and communication between AI agents and physical robot systems.

## Overview

ROS 2 serves as the distributed nervous system for robots, enabling effective communication between different components and systems. This module will cover:

- Core ROS 2 concepts: nodes, topics, services
- Python agents with rclpy for connecting AI logic to robot controllers
- Humanoid structure representation with URDF (Unified Robot Description Format)

## Learning Objectives

After completing this module, you will be able to:
- Explain the ROS 2 architecture and its role as a distributed nervous system
- Create Python-based ROS 2 nodes using rclpy
- Interpret humanoid URDF files and understand the software-body connection

## Prerequisites

- Python programming background
- Basic understanding of robotics concepts (helpful but not required)

## Structure

This module is divided into three main chapters:
1. [ROS 2 Core Concepts](./core-concepts.md) - Understanding nodes, topics, and services
2. [Python Agents with rclpy](./python-agents-rclpy.md) - Creating ROS 2 nodes in Python
3. [Humanoid Structure with URDF](./humanoid-urdf.md) - Robot body representation

Let's begin exploring how ROS 2 functions as the nervous system for robotic systems.
