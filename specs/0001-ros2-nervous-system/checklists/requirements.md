# Specification Quality Checklist: Module 1 — The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-12-20
**Feature**: specs/001-ros2-nervous-system/spec.md

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs) - Specification focuses on concepts, not specific implementations
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs - Addresses learning objectives for AI engineers and robotics students
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders - Clear language with educational focus
- [x] All mandatory sections completed - User scenarios, requirements, success criteria all present

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain - All clarifications resolved
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous - Each requirement has clear criteria
- [x] Success criteria are measurable - Specific percentages and outcomes defined
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details) - Focused on learning outcomes
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined - Each user story has clear Given/When/Then scenarios
- [x] Edge cases are identified - Considered different user backgrounds and needs
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded - Focus on ROS 2 concepts, not hardware or advanced control theory
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified - Target audience and prerequisites clear

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria - Each requirement is specific and testable
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows - Core learning journeys are addressed
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria - Clear metrics for success
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification - Maintains conceptual focus

## Notes

- All validation items pass - Specification is ready for planning phase
