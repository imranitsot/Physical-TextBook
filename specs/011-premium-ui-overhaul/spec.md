# Spec 011: Premium UI Overhaul

## 1. Background
The initial Docusaurus template was too generic. The "Physical AI Textbook" requires a high-tech, futuristic aesthetic to match its subject matter (robotics, AI, simulation).

## 2. Requirements
*   **Theme**: Dark mode by default with "Electric Blue" and "Neon Purple" accents.
*   **Homepage**: comprehensive redesign. Replace generic "Features" with "4 Pillars of Physical AI" (Nervous System, Body, Brain, Twin).
*   **Branding**: Custom logo (Hexagon + Neural Net) and Favicon.
*   **Visuals**: Animated hero gradients and glassmorphism cards.

## 3. Design
*   **CSS Variables**: Override `--ifm-color-primary` to `#00d2ff`.
*   **Footer**: Custom gradient background `linear-gradient(180deg, #050608 0%, #0a0b10 100%)`.
