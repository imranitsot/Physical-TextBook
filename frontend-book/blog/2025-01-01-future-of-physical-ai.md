We are standing at the precipice of a new technological revolution. For decades, "Artificial Intelligence" meant code that lived on servers—processing text, images, and numbers in the abstract digital ether.

Today, that changes. **Intelligence has found a body.**

## The Convergence

The "Physical AI Textbook" was built to document this historic convergence. We are witnessing the fusion of three distinct fields:
1.  **Robotics**: The mechanics of actuation and kinematics.
2.  **Computer Vision**: The eyes that perceive the world.
3.  **Language Models**: The reasoning engines that understand intent.

When you combine these, you get **Embodied Intelligence**—agents that can not only think but *act*.

## Why We Need Physical AI?

Traditional automation is brittle. A factory robot can weld a car door perfectly a million times, but if you move the door one inch, the robot fails. 

**Physical AI** is different. It is adaptive. Through techniques like **Reinforcement Learning** (Module 6) and **VLA Systems** (Module 5), robots are learning to handle the messiness of the real world. They are moving from "pre-programmed loops" to "goal-oriented policies."

This textbook is your guide to building that future. We hope you enjoy the journey.
