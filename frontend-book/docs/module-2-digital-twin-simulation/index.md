# Module 2: The Digital Twin

Before we build, we simulate. A Digital Twin is a cycle-accurate replica of your robot in a virtual world. This module focuses on physics-based simulation and virtual environments for digital twins of humanoid robots, covering Gazebo physics simulation, Unity environments, and simulated sensors for AI system training.

## Overview

Digital twins enable the creation of virtual representations of physical robot systems, allowing for testing and development without hardware constraints. This module will cover:

- Physics simulation with Gazebo for realistic environments
- High-fidelity environments in Unity for visual realism
- Simulated sensors for realistic data streams to AI systems

## Learning Objectives

After completing this module, you will be able to:
- Understand physics simulation with Gazebo including gravity, collisions, and rigid-body dynamics
- Create high-fidelity environments in Unity with visual realism for human-robot interaction
- Configure simulated sensors (LiDAR, depth cameras, IMUs) and understand their data flow to AI systems

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of robotics concepts
- Familiarity with simulation environments (helpful but not required)

## Structure

This module is divided into three main chapters:
1. [Physics Simulation with Gazebo](./physics-simulation-gazebo.md) - Core physics concepts and simulation
2. [High-Fidelity Environments in Unity](./high-fidelity-unity.md) - Visual environments and interaction
3. [Simulated Sensors](./simulated-sensors.md) - Sensor simulation and data flow

Let's begin exploring how digital twins enable effective simulation for humanoid robotics.
