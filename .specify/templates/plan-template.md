# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/sp.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: [e.g., Python 3.11, Swift 5.9, Rust 1.75 or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Primary Dependencies**: [e.g., FastAPI, UIKit, LLVM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Storage**: [if applicable, e.g., PostgreSQL, CoreData, files or N/A]  
**Testing**: [e.g., pytest, XCTest, cargo test or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Target Platform**: [e.g., Linux server, iOS 15+, WASM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Project Type**: [single/web/mobile - determines source structure]  
**Performance Goals**: [domain-specific, e.g., 1000 req/s, 10k lines/sec, 60 fps or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Constraints**: [domain-specific, e.g., <200ms p95, <100MB memory, offline-capable or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Scale/Scope**: [domain-specific, e.g., 10k users, 1M LOC, 50 screens or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Core Principles Verification:**
- [ ] Spec-first development: Implementation must be preceded by formal specification
- [ ] Accuracy aligned with official documentation: All content/code verified against authoritative sources
- [ ] Clarity for software engineers and AI practitioners: Documentation accessible to target audiences
- [ ] Full reproducibility: Build processes and deployments work consistently across environments
- [ ] Reusable intelligence: Agents and subagents have clearly defined scopes and interfaces

**Book Standards Verification:**
- [ ] Docusaurus-based documentation with Markdown formatting
- [ ] GitHub Pages deployment capability
- [ ] Structured chapters with objectives, examples, and summaries
- [ ] Flesch-Kincaid grade level 10-12 maintained
- [ ] Original content with 0% plagiarism

**RAG Chatbot Standards Verification:**
- [ ] Context-restricted operation (book content or user-selected text only)
- [ ] Specified technology stack used (FastAPI, OpenAI Agents/ChatKit SDKs, Neon Serverless Postgres, Qdrant Cloud)
- [ ] Explicit source citation for all responses

**Validation & Testing Verification:**
- [ ] Docusaurus build passes without errors
- [ ] GitHub Pages deployment succeeds consistently
- [ ] RAG retrieval is deterministic and traceable
- [ ] Context-restricted answering is enforced programmatically

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
