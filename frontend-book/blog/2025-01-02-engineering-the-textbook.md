Building the **Physical AI Textbook** was not just about writing comparisons of algorithms; it was about designing a learning experience. We wanted to create a resource that felt as high-tech as the subject matter itself.

## The 4 Pillars

We structured the book around the anatomy of a robot, breaking it down into four key pillars:

1.  **The Nervous System**: Covered in **[Module 1: The Nervous System (ROS 2)](/docs/module-1-ros2-nervous-system)**, this explores ROS 2 as the distributed data bus.
2.  **The Digital Twin**: In **[Module 2: The Digital Twin (Simulation)](/docs/module-2-digital-twin-simulation)**, we emphasize that simulation is key to safety.
3.  **The Body**: In **[Module 3: Hardware Basics](/docs/hardware-basics/module-3-hardware)** and **[Module 4: Humanoid Design](/docs/humanoid-design/module-4-humanoid-design)**, we dive into the nuts and bolts—literally.
4.  **The Brain**: Finally, **[Module 5: VLA Foundations](/docs/vla-systems/module-5-vla-foundations)** and **[Module 6: Advanced AI Control](/docs/advanced-ai-control/module-6-advanced-ai)** bring it all to life with VLA and RL.

## Visual Learning

In Physical AI, a picture is worth a thousand lines of code. That's why we invested heavily in creating custom diagrams for every single module.

From the **Zero Moment Point** diagrams to **Lidar Point Clouds**, every image is designed to clarify complex concepts instantly.

We hope this textbook serves as a solid foundation for your own innovations.

Happy Building,
